This automated billing system is a application that interfaces with a hardware device
i.e., arduino via a serial port. The system is designed to read data from the tags, update
the GUI in real time, and manage a simple billing process.The system maintains a
running total of the rates of all items added. This total is updated each time a new item
is read from the device. The items and their rates are also added to a billing table
displayed in the GUI, providing a clear and organized view of all items being billed.
